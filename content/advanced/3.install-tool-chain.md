### Getting started

If you want to experiment with Amazon FreeRTOS on your own you can check the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/freertos-getting-started.html).

For this lab, we are going to use a pre-configured example where we already have the code needed to interact with the peripherals on the daughter board.

In this lab we are going to follow the instructions of this project [https://github.com/EponaLab/afr-alexa-smarthome](https://github.com/EponaLab/afr-alexa-smarthome).

Click on the link and follow the README.
