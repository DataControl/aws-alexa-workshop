In this chapter, we will create a new workspace for you to do the lab using cloud9.  


{{% notice tip %}}
The reason for setting up of a cloud9 environment here is to **prevent dependencies installing conflict with your local environment**. It doesn't mean that we have to use cloud9 for Alexa development.
If you have confidence that your local PC or your server has a rather pure environment, you could also skip this session. But to guarantee the success of the lab and no time will be wasted on solving conflicts, we **highly recommend following these instructions**.

{{% notice warning %}}
The Cloud9 workspace should be built by an IAM user with Administrator privileges,
not the root account user. Please ensure you are logged in as an **IAM user (account id+ username + password)**, not the root
account user (email + password directly).
