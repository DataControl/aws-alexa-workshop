[Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/) is Amazonâ€™s cloud-based voice service available on tens of millions of 
devices from Amazon and third-party device manufacturers. With Alexa, you can build natural voice experiences that 
offer customers a more intuitive way to interact with the technology they use every day. Our collection of tools, 
APIs, reference solutions, and documentation make it easy for anyone to build with Alexa.

The intent of this workshop is to educate users about the development of Alexa Skills using AWS services. We
will cover a few AWS products which can help us speed up the development, including **Amazon Cognito User Pools**,
**AWS Lambda**, **AppSync**, **DynamoDB**, **IoT Core**, **Amplify Framework**, **Amplify Console**, **AWS Cloud9**,
**Amazon Lex** and etc.

Specifically, we will walk you through the following labs:

* [How to Build an Alexa Custom Skill]({{< ref "/custom-skill/_index.md" >}})
* [How to Build an Alexa Smart Home Skill]({{< ref "/smart-home/_index.md" >}})
